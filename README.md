# ChapeauPOS

ChapeauPOS is a web application designed for restaurants that provides a comprehensive Point of Sale (POS) system built with the .NET MVC framework. This application is tailored to streamline restaurant operations, allowing for efficient order management, tracking sales, and managing inventory.

## Project Overview

ChapeauPOS is developed to offer a user-friendly interface while maintaining robust backend functionalities. The main objectives of this project are:
- Simplifying the ordering process for staff
- Providing management tools for tracking sales, managing inventory, and viewing reports
- Ensuring reliability and security for transaction handling

## MVC Pattern

The application follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architectural pattern, which separates the application into three interconnected components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It interacts with the database and performs operations such as fetching, creating, and updating records.
- **View**: The user interface of the application, which displays data and sends user commands to the controller. It is designed to be intuitive and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience for end-users.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It processes user input, interacts with the Model, and returns the output display to the View.

## Database Design

The database for ChapeauPOS is carefully designed to ensure data integrity and efficiency. Key features include:

- **Normalized Tables**: Organized structure for Users, Orders, Menu Items, and Inventory to reduce redundancy
- **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key relationships established to maintain data consistency across tables
- **Optimized Queries**: Structured for efficient data retrieval and manipulation

## Frontend Design

The frontend design for ChapeauPOS was crafted using **Figma**, focusing on user experience and functionality. The design process involved:

- Creating wireframes to outline the structure and layout of the application
- Developing high-fidelity designs with all UI elements to align with branding and usability standards
- Ensuring responsive design for various screen sizes

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: .NET MVC, C# (53.9%)
- **Frontend**: HTML (37.9%), CSS (8.2%)
- **Database**: SQL Server
- **Design Tool**: Figma

## Conclusion

ChapeauPOS aims to enhance the efficiency of restaurant operations and improve customer satisfaction through a modern, reliable POS system. With continuous development and updates, it will serve the needs of both restaurant staff and management effectively.
